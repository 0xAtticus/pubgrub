/// An incompatibility is a set of terms for different packages
/// that should never be satisfied all together.
/// An incompatibility usually originates from a package dependency.
/// For example, if package A at version 1 depends on package B
/// at version 2, you can never have both terms `A = 1`
/// and `not B = 2` satisfied at the same time in a partial solution.
/// This would mean that we found a solution with package A at version 1
/// but not with package B at version 2.
/// Yet A at version 1 depends on B at version 2 so this is not possible.
/// Therefore, the set `{ A = 1, not B = 2 }` is an incompatibility,
/// defined from dependencies of A at version 1.
///
/// Incompatibilities can also be derived from two other incompatibilities
/// during conflict resolution. More about all this in
/// [PubGrub documentation](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/blob/master/doc/solver.md#incompatibility).
